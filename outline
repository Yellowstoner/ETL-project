* data sources
1. https://www.kaggle.com/aravindram11/list-of-us-airports - List of US Airports - a month ago
3. https://www.kaggle.com/anshuls235/airline-delay-causes - Airline On-Time Statistics and Delay Causes - The data set which contains information on United State flight delays and performance comes from RITA. 2 months ago

Extract
* The sources of data that you will extract from.
    - A database which List of US Airports and their geolocation coordinates which can be used for plotting on a map for analysis;
    - pulled from Federal Aviation Administration web page
* How they were obtained 

Transform
* How/Where were they placed
    - Put each CSV into a pandas DataFrame.
* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
    - kaggle files csv ready. FAA data had to be converted. renamed from "preliminary-cy19-all-enplanements.xlsx" to "2019-enplanements.csv"
        - airports: Deleted "COUNTRY", "LATITUDE", and "LONGITUDE" as deemed unnecessary.
        - delays: Deleted ['Unnamed: 21'] column and only presented data from the year 2019\
        
        - Merge Airports and delays to ensure accurate
        - Merge the 

* Copy only the columns needed into a new DataFrame.
* Rename columns to fit the tables created in the database.
* Handle any duplicates.
    - HINT: some locations have the same name but each license number is unique.
* Set index to the previously created primary key.

Load
* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.
* Create a connection to database.
* Check for a successful connection to the database and confirm that the tables have been created.
* Append DataFrames to tables. Be sure to use the index set earlier.
* Confirm successful Load by querying database.

You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.
